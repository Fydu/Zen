ZEN - Track your daily calories
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/zQIKkdPqp7g
#### Description:

This is my final project for Harvard's CS50 made with HTML, CSS, Javascript, Flask, Jinja and SQL.
It's a web-based application that allows you to track your daily caloric intake, as well as decide how much you should eat based on your goals.
I felt inspired to work on this because, near the end of the course, I started tracking my calories and had to search for a tool to do so.
I worked on this project for about 2-3 weeks, and beforehand I had decided to take some more online courses and watch some tutorials to reinforce my CSS knowledge (such as freeCodeCamp's)which really came in handy.
